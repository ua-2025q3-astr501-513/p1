# ASTR 513 Mid-Term Project

Welcome to the repository for the **Mid-Term Project** in ASTR 513.
This project is worth **20 points** and is designed to let you apply
numerical techniques that we covered in the classes.
You are recommended to form teams of 3 to 6 people.

Presentations will be scheduled for October 13th or 15th.
The final project package, including presentation slides and any
supporting materials, must be submitted on the day of the presentation
by 11:59pm (Arizona time).

Code submission is handled by GitHub classroom.
Please use [this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/nqfiwWTG) to
join a project.

The included file "ideas.yaml" is a compilation of proposed ideas,
covering areas that are covered in the first half of ASTR 513.
You may pick one of these ideas and find other students who have
common interests to form team.
Examples of previous projects inlcude

A formal write-up is not required, but you must:

1. Submit well-documented source code with clear comments through
   GitHub classroom.
   Provide docstrings and update this README to explain how to run
   your project and discusses any dependencies.

2. Deliver a short (about 10 minutes) presentation on October 13th or
   15th, using either slides (standard presentation) or a Jupyter
   notebook (like our class), to describe the problem you tackled and
   how you solved it.
   Show your numerical methods, data or results, and any plots or
   tables that shed light on your findings.
   Each team member should be ready to discuss their contributions.

Your project will be graded out of 20 points with the following
general breakdown:
i) originality and clarity of the idea,
ii) quality of the solution,
iii) thoroughness of the documentation, and
iv) effectiveness of the presentation.

Project is handled by GitHub classroom as well, where multiple
students can create a single repository to track codes.
Only one submission (code + documentation) per team is needed.
Be sure to list all group members.

Late submissions may not be accepted, so plan ahead and start
early.

We look forward to seeing your creativity and thoroughness as you
tackle a meaningful computational physics problem!
