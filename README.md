submitted on time.
Frequent and incremental `git commit` and `git push` are recommended
to ensure your latest work are seen.


## Additional Notes

* Collaboration:
  You are encouraged to discuss ideas with your peers, but your
  submission must reflect your own work and understanding.
* AI:
  When using AI, you must follow the course policy.
  The bottomline is that you may use AI as a collaborator to help you
  learn, but the code must reflect your own work and understanding.
* Help and Resources:
  If you encounter any difficulties, please refer to the course
  materials, consult your instructor, or seek help during office
  hours.
* Deadlines:
  Be mindful of the submission deadline, as late submissions will not
  be accepted.

Good luck!
